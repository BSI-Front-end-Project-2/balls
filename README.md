Project 2 of BSI 20-21 front-end

## Introduction
This is a website project made in HTML, CSS, Javascript; made for an hipotetical ball game.

## Usage
start project from index.html, various buttons are available for game management (speed,size,start,stop..)

## Configuration and technical characteristics
Languages used for this project:
- HTML
- CSS
- javascript

We used github for collaborate purpose

#### General
- [x] Create an application that allows users to create and interact with bouncing balls, similar
to examples demonstrated in class and the included screenshots and with the following
requirements
    - [x]new balls should be generated when the use clicks and drags the mouse
    - [ ]the speed of the balls should depend on the speed of the mouse movement
    - [x]the direction of the balls should depend on the direction of motion of the mouse
    - [x]the balls should bounce at the edges of the container
    - [x]scrollbars should not appear when the balls hit the edges of the container
    - [x]the ball movement should have some physicality (weight, gravity, speed)
    - [x]it should be possible to 'freeze' and 'resume' the animation
    - [x]the user should be able to choose the 'skin' of the balls, colors, images, etc
    - [x]the user should be able to make the balls bigger or smaller with keyboard shortcuts and onscreen buttons
    - [x]the user should be able to remove balls (e.g. by clicking on them or on a button)
    - [x]the user should be able to to increase/decrease the speed of balls with keyboard shortcuts and           onscreenbuttons
    - [x] the page should be page responsive, meaning that when the user changes the size of the
    page, the balls never go out of their container and all page controls are repositioned to fit
    the viewport
    - [x] an onscreen counter that displays the current number of balls

#### Optional
- [ ] adding game rules
- [ ] adding backgrounds and images
- [x] adding sounds or music
- [x] generate balls of random sizes and colors

#### Important
- Use meaningful names
- The code should be well documented
- The code should be well indented
- The data structures should be effective and the code should be efficient
- You need to be able to explain each line of your code

## Bonuses delivered
- [] Magnet
Right clicking and holding the mouse attracts all the balls to the position of the mouse
When releasing the mouse button the balls return to their original behavior
- [] Ball trails
Balls should show shadow trails behind them to show the previous positions they were
in. Search for "mouse trails" images to understand what this means
- [x] Gravity
Add a slider to adjust gravity and impact the ball movement. You can add other factors

## Browser compatibility
- Chrome Fully Compatible
- Mozilla Firefox Fully Compatible
- Not compatible with IE
